# Regression Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a regression project that aims to predict a target variable based on a set of input features. 

## Overview

The project utilizes various regression techniques to analyze and model the relationship between the target variable and the predictors.

## Contents

- `data`: This folder contains the dataset used for training and testing the regression models.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `scripts`: Python scripts that provide utility functions and helper classes for the regression process.
- `results`: This folder stores the evaluation metrics, visualizations, and saved models.
